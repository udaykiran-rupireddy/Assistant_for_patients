# Assistant_for_patients
A python code that runs on raspberry pi. 
It continuously shows current time.Initially the required times must be set along with the medicine names to be taken.
At the mentioned time the code will wait for our command to be given as 1 or 0.
If we suppose 1 is considered as button pressed which indicates medicine is taken.If button is not pressed we consider it as 0. In that case the care taker will receive an email stating that the particaular medicine is not taken.
Hence it tells the patients the current time and reminds them about medicine to be taken at a particular time of the day. It helps the caretaker to identify patient's location.An email is sent to the caretaker. 
The following is an example for the message sent.

This is made as a part of my final year major project in 7th semester Dec 2021.
This is an initial automation code to represent the idea of the project.
