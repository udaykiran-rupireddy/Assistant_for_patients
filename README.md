# Assistant_for_patients
A python code that runs on raspberry pi. It tells the patients the current time and reminds them about medicine to be taken at a particular time of the day. It helps the caretaker to identify patient's location.
This is made as a part of my final year major project in 7th semester oct 2021.
This is an initial automation code to represent the idea of the project.
